10 Seconds Ludum Dare
============
This is my entry into Ludum Dare 27

You are a scientist surveying an imploding world in a distance solar system. Evidence suggests another civilization once resided here tens-of-thousands of years ago, and mined all available resources from the planet, leaving it a collapsing husk. While studying the deteriorating planet from the comfort of your spaceship, and freak magnetic storm tears a hole in the hull and sends you spinning to the earth. While you are fortunate to have survived, all of your backup batteries, supplies and distress beacon were sucked out of the ruptured hull. Worst of all, the thick, corrosive atmosphere of the planet blocks out the sun, preventing any of your devices or your environmental suit from recharging. You find yourself alone amongst the remains of your ship, under a darkened sky, powerless. You feel the acidic air pressing in, eager to rend the flesh from your bones. Disturbingly, the air is so thick with corrosive chemicals you can only hope to siphon 10 seconds of life from each of the batteries you find.

If you hope to survive, you must find batteries to recharge your environmental shield and your distress beacon before it's too late.


Instructions:
============

Install SFML. I found that it was better to compile and install it yourself from source. The binaries as they were compiled for OSX didn't function. Head over to [SFML Download Page](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) for details.

After that, just run make.
